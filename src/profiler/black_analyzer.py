    # For now, we assume it is.

    # Placeholder for actual file analysis results
    # In a real scenario, we would iterate through files and format them.
    # Black's API for diff output when not changing files can be complex to capture
    # directly without running as a subprocess.
    # Let's simulate how one might capture output if black.Mode(diff=True, check=True)
    # printed to stdout.

    # For now, let's just return empty strings as a placeholder
    # The actual implementation will require careful handling of how Black outputs diffs
    # when used as a library for --check and --diff.

    # A more robust way for --check --diff is often to use subprocess:
    # import subprocess
    # all_diffs = []
    # all_errors = []
    # for file_path in file_paths:
    #     try:

    #             text=True,
    #             check=False # Don't raise exception for non-zero exit if files would be reformatted
    #         )
    #         # Black's diff output goes to stdout, errors to stderr.
    #         # Exit code 0: no changes needed
    #         # Exit code 1: files would be reformatted
    #         # Exit code >1: error
    #         if process.stdout:
    #             all_diffs.append(f"--- Diff for {file_path} ---\n{process.stdout}")

    #             all_errors.append(f"--- Errors for {file_path} ---\n{process.stderr}")

    # The python API approach:
    # black.Mode can be configured with check=True and diff=True.
    # However, format_file_in_place (and format_str) with these settings
    # typically indicates changes by raising Changed (if check=True, diff=False)
    # or by printing to stdout (if diff=True). Capturing this stdout when
    # using the API directly requires redirecting sys.stdout.
