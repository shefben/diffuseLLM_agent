# To perform a real style scoring, this function would need access to:
# 1. The established project style profile (e.g., from 'config/style_fingerprint.json').
# from src.profiler.profile_io import load_style_profile
# from src.profiler.llm_interfacer import get_style_fingerprint_from_llm # To get fingerprint of the sample
# (Or a more direct way to analyze the sample's style aspects)

# For now, these are conceptual dependencies for a real implementation.

) -> float:
    """
    Scores the style of a given code sample file against the established
    project style profile. Returns a score indicating deviation.

    The scoring convention could be:
    - 0.0: Perfect match with project style.
    - 1.0: Maximum deviation from project style.
    (Other conventions are possible, e.g., a similarity score where 1.0 is perfect).
    For now, let's use 0.0 = perfect, 1.0 = max deviation.


    Args:
        sample_path: Path to the Python code file to score.
        project_profile: Optional. The pre-loaded project's unified style profile as a dictionary.
                         If not provided, a real implementation might try to load it.
        # config_path: Path to the project's style_fingerprint.json.
        #              Used if project_profile is not directly provided.

    Returns:
        A float score between 0.0 (no deviation) and 1.0 (max deviation).
        This is a placeholder implementation.

    # --- Placeholder Implementation ---
    # A real implementation would:
    # 1. Load the project_profile if not provided (e.g., from config_path).
    #    if project_profile is None:
    #        project_profile = load_style_profile(config_path)
    #        if project_profile is None:
    #            print(f"Error: Could not load project style profile from {config_path}")
    #            return 1.0 # Max deviation if profile unavailable

    # 2. Analyze the sample_path to extract its style characteristics.
    #    This might involve:
    #    - Reading the file content.
    #    - Using a simplified version of the LLM fingerprinter, or specific checks for:
    #        - Formatting issues (e.g., running Black/Ruff in --check mode)
    #        - Naming convention adherence (checking identifiers against rules in naming_conventions.db)
    #        - Docstring style adherence.
    #    sample_fingerprint = get_style_fingerprint_from_llm(sample_path.read_text()) # Conceptual

    # 3. Compare the sample's characteristics against the project_profile.
    #    Calculate a deviation score based on differences in:
    #    - Indentation, quotes, line length.
    #    - Naming convention mismatches (e.g., percentage of non-compliant names).
    #    - Docstring format mismatches.
    #    - Presence/absence of type hints if project profile has a strong preference.
    #    - Etc.

    # 4. Aggregate these differences into a single score (0.0 to 1.0).

    # For this placeholder, return a dummy score.
    # Let's make it slightly random to simulate some level of analysis.
    # A real score would be deterministic for the same input and profile.
    dummy_deviation_score = random.uniform(0.0, 0.3) # Simulate mostly good style for now
