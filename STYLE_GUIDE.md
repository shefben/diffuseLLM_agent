# Project Style Guide

This document outlines the coding style, formatting conventions, and naming patterns for this project.
It is intended to be maintained and updated by the AI Coding Assistant based on its analysis and configurations.

## 1. Formatting

Formatting is primarily managed by **Black** and **Ruff**. Configurations for these tools can be found in `pyproject.toml`.

- **Black Configuration:** See `[tool.black]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Ruff Configuration:** See `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`.

## 2. Linting

Linting is performed by **Ruff**. See its configuration for enabled rules.

## 3. Docstrings

The AI Coding Assistant will determine or define a consistent docstring style.

**Current Recommended Docstring Style:** (To be filled by the assistant)

**Example:** (To be filled by the assistant)

```python
def example_function(param1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Summary of the function.

    Args:

    Returns:
        bool: Description of the return value.
    """
    # ... implementation ...
    return True
```

## 4. Naming Conventions

The AI Coding Assistant will determine or define consistent naming conventions.

-   **Modules:** (To be filled by the assistant, e.g., `snake_case.py`)
-   **Packages:** (To be filled by the assistant, e.g., `snake_case`)
-   **Classes:** (To be filled by the assistant, e.g., `PascalCase`)
-   **Functions & Methods:** (To be filled by the assistant, e.g., `snake_case`)
